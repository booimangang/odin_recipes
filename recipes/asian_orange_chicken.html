    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Orange chicken is a popular item at Chinese restaurants. It consists of
      small cubes of chicken that are breaded, pan-fried, and coated in an
      orange sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orange sauce is sweet with a little tang and a hint of spice. It's
      mainly known for its orange flavor (as you can guess from the name). It's
      typically made with orange juice and orange zest to achieve the citrus
      flavor.
